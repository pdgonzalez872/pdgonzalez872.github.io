<p class="my-4">
  I've finally been able to put together a few thoughts I've had into something
  that may help some folks in the future. At least it will help myself, since I
  can link to this post when this comes up again.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  After working in a few large Elixir codebases, I've noticed a recurring
  pattern: lingering <span class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded font-mono text-sm">stub/3</span> calls that can safely be removed from tests without
  changing behavior. When removed, nothing fails. More importantly, there's a
  missed opportunity to use <span class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded font-mono text-sm">expect/3</span>, which in most cases would have been the
  right tool.
</p>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-6">
  The Problem: Dead Code in Your Tests
</div>

<p class="my-4">
  The stub is a mute button. A test that used to tell you that a contract was
  to be respected (an implementation would be called at some point) no longer
  tells you anything. In fact, it tricks you into thinking that it does, but it
  doesn't.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  Even by using setup <span class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded font-mono text-sm">:verify_on_exit!</span>, nothing happens. We still get the
  misdirection and dead code in the codebase because <span class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded font-mono text-sm">stub/3</span> allows things to be
  called zero times. The best thing about Mox is verifying that the contract is
  exercised. The moment it is no longer exercised, I'd want tests to warn me
  about it.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  The false negative here is what bothers me the most: I don't know that
  something STOPPED being called. These are annoying and usually cause
  surprises.
</p>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-6">
  Why This Happens
</div>

<p class="my-4">
  From what I've seen, folks reach for <span class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded font-mono text-sm">stub/3</span> because it's an overloaded term
  in testing, much like "mock" (as shown in <a
  href="https://dashbit.co/blog/mocks-and-explicit-contracts" class="text-blue-400"
  target="_blank">this excellent Dashbit article</a>). Folks are well-meaning,
  but the end result seems to always be the same:
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  The reasons for this happening are mostly:
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  - The term "stub" feels familiar from other libraries and languages. Many users
  don't immediately notice or understand <span class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded font-mono text-sm">expect/3</span> as the verification-based
  alternative and how powerful it is.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  - People often come from other ecosystems where the word "stub" has a different
  meaning than in ours. Once I show how a certain stub call can be removed and
  mention <span class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded font-mono text-sm">expect/3</span>, it tends to click for them.
</p>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-6">
  Why expect/3 is Better
</div>

<p class="my-4">
  The best thing about <span class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded font-mono text-sm">expect/3</span> is that it verifies the contract is exercised.
  When a contract stops being exercised, your tests will immediately fail and
  warn you. This is exactly what you want: early feedback when something
  changes.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  With <span class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded font-mono text-sm">stub/3</span>, you lose this verification. The test might pass, but you've lost
  valuable information about whether your code is actually using the dependency
  you thought it was.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  I added some docs to Mox to try to communicate this. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/dashbitco/mox/issues/168"
    class="text-blue-400" target="_blank">Mox Github issue</a> discussing these
  symptoms and here is the <a href="https://github.com/dashbitco/mox/pull/169"
    class="text-blue-400" target="_blank">PR that addresses it</a>.
</p>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-6">
  Conclusion
</div>

<p class="my-4">
  Reach for <span class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded font-mono text-sm">expect/3</span> by default. It verifies your contracts are
  actually being exercised and will warn you immediately when they stop being
  used. Save <span class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded font-mono text-sm">stub/3</span> for the rare cases where you truly need zero-or-more-times
  semantics.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  Your tests should be a safety net that catches when things change, not a
  mute button that hides what's happening.
