  I sometimes use DBeaver (open source version) when I'm not using psql to do
  some db related work or doing some research on bugs. While psql is usually
  enough (mostly due to being able to pass in files with existing queries)
  sometimes it's nice to have a different option. DBeaver was suggested in a
  previous company and I enjoy using it, it's my go to for db GUIs after psql.

  I'm writing this blog because I always forget what the db connection string
  has to look like in DBeaver and it's not the same as the psql one. So this
  will save me some research time in the future.

  The URL is like the following: `jdbc:postgresql://HOST:PORT/DB_NAME` and the
  username/password are input in their respective fields in the GUI. Here is a
  screenshot:
