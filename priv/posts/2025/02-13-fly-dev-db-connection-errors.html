EDIT: I recently had to do this again and the `destroy` command applied on a
primary didn't automatically promote one of the replicas. I'm unsure of why at
the moment (maybe I haven't done the below on this physical machine, maybe the
cli had a bad update? - unsure), but the solution was to `ssh` into the db app
and manually promote a replica to primary using `repmgr`. I have notes and will
write them down when I have a little bit of time later today. For now, I think
you need to do a `failover` manually for the below to work as you'd expect.

  Sometimes, things break. That's just how things are. One time, I realized I
  was getting DbConnection errors in an app hosted on Fly (using Fly Posgres),
  even with low usage in an app. It was odd, came out of nowhere. You could see
  the connections dropping and then going back up.

  The confusing thing was that there was no trigger for this. It just started
  happening. After some research, I decided to contact Fly's support, which
  have always been super helpful. They showed me that one of the three machines
  I had for my database was stuck in a boot loop and would never reach
  available state. It seemed like it was just long enough to take some
  connections from the pool, but would crash soon later. It was there on the
  dashboard if you looked at all the machines. It was tucked a click away
  though, I was not able to see it from the main dashboard, the db (overall
  health) was green. Now I know to look there and in hindsight, I should have.

  Support gave me direction on how to fix the problem. In short, you had to
  destroy the bad machine and clone a good one. That's why we have more than 1
  machine (like Fly suggests). As usual, I write a lot when working and had
  some notes. When this happened again a couple weeks back, I was prepared.
  Here are the notes that have helped me:

  Hope this helps! It has helped me a couple of times already. I also want to
  give props to Fly's email support. It's always been helpful.
