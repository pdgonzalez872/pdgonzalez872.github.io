  I wanted to write about platform tennis. It's a great racket sport I picked
  up after college that helped me in many ways in my life. It helped me develop
  my body (my shoulder doubled in size), allowed me to improve my volleys and
  work on my favorite part of the game: overheads. I had a blast competing,
  playing the Chicago league and traveling to tournaments.

  I eventually made a decision to not return to platform after the 2020 break.
  It had become less of a priority and injury was just a matter of time.

  Below is a video of my playing and <a

    target="_blank">here are some good points from my end with different kinds
  of overheads.</a>

  And here is something I'm extremely proud of, likely my highest achievement
  in racket sports in my career so far: <a

  Platform was great for me and I suggest you try it!
