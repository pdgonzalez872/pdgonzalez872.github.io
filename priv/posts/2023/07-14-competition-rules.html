<p class="my-4">
  It took me a while to learn to perform well when competing. Performance for
  me mostly came in the shape of a racket sports competition at the time.  But,
  it's been the same for other things too (music, work, sports, etc). In
  college I was able to come up with 3 rules for performing:
</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li class="mb-2">- play your very best, always</li>
  <li class="mb-2">- play the next point better than the last</li>
  <li class="mb-2">- don't be silly, which means not doing anything that could interfere with 1 and 2.</li>
</ol>

<p class="my-4">
  This model has helped me a lot not just in racket sports competitions but also in life.
