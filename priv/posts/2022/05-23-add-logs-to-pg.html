<p class="my-4">
  Following up on the concept of introspection, I thought it would be
  interesting to see Postgres' runtime logs. They are turned off by default (a
  lot happens in Postgres :) ) but we can turn them on and it is beneficial to
  see more info about what is going on under the hood. There was a good
  <a
    href="https://chartio.com/resources/tutorials/how-to-log-queries-in-postgresql/#verifying-log-generation" class="text-blue-400" target="_blank">article</a>
  that showed the steps to set it up. Here are the steps I did to get the logs going:
</p>

<p class="my-4">
In order to enable logs, we should figure out where the config file is located
as well as where the logs will be output to.
</p>

<pre class="text-xs"><code># Get the location for the config file
postgres=# show config_file;
               config_file
-----------------------------------------
 /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf
(1 row)

# Now, let's see where the data folder is located:
postgres=# show data_directory;
       data_directory
-----------------------------
 /var/lib/postgresql/14/main
(1 row)
</code></pre>

<p class="my-4">
  So let's open up the config file and make some changes:
</p>

<pre class="text-xs"><code># I made these changes:
# sudo vim /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf

log_destination = 'csvlog'
logging_collector = on
log_directory = 'log'
log_filename = 'postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log'
log_rotation_age = 1d
log_min_messages = debug1
</code></pre>

<p class="my-4">
  With these changes, we can restart the service and check some logs out:
</p>

<pre class="text-xs"><code>sudo service postgresql restart
</code></pre>

<p class="my-4">
  Now, let's make a typo and force a log (ERROR):
</p>

<pre class="text-xs"><code>paulo@s76 ~ $ psql -h localhost -U postgres
Password for user postgres:
psql (14.2 (Ubuntu 14.2-1.pgdg20.04+1+b1))

Type "help" for help.

postgres=# select count(1) from does_not_exist;
ERROR:  relation "does_not_exist" does not exist
LINE 1: select count(1) from does_not_exist;
                             ^
postgres=#
</code></pre>

<p class="my-4">
  Here is the log!
</p>

<pre class="text-xs"><code>
paulo@s76 ~ $ sudo tail -f /var/lib/postgresql/14/main/log/postgresql-2022-05-23_164455.csv | ag ERROR

</code></pre>

<p class="my-4">
  If you want to see ALL the logs, you can set the below to `all` and it will log all queries. Just don't do it in a prod server.
</p>

<pre class="text-xs"><code>
log_statement = all
</code></pre>

  Conclusion -> Postgres rocks :)
