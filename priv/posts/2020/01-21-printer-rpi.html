  It is neat to be able to send things to the printer from any machine within the
  network. Saves some steps, saves having to connect the printer USB to your
  machine. A better reason is: great to learn a little bit more about the amazing
  open source tools we have at our disposal.

  is a great resource. I've started following them on
  Twitter and it has been great to see new articles.

  I followed parts of the tutorial[0] on PiMyLifeUp. The model for the printer I
  have (Brother 2240) didn't show up in the CUPS admin interface,
  <a href="https://njh.eu/printer" class="text-blue-400" target="_blank">but you can get
the PPF file from a source</a>, follow the instructions there and things should work.

<pre class="text-xs"><code>## Copy from local (your machine) to remote (the pi), place it in `~` on the pi
$ scp file_on_my_local_machine.pdf pi@192.168.0.42:.

## Copy from remote to local (just to show how this would work)
$ scp pi@192.168.0.42:/home/pi/dev/file_on_the_remote.txt new_file_name.txt
pi@192.168.0.42's password: # I entered the password correctly

## Once you moved the file to the pi, you can ssh into it and print it:

## ssh into the pi and print
$ ssh pi@192.168.0.42
## it will ask you for your password. If you don't have a password, STOP
## EVERYTHING and go set one. If you password is "raspberry" (the default), STOP
## EVERYTHING and go change it.

## Select the file and print
$ pi@raspberry:~ $ lp article_on_the_remote.pdf
</code></pre>
