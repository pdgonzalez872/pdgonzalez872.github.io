  Oct/25/2024 update: I made the Team USA (35+) that will compete at the PanAms
  in Argentina in December. Let's GO!
</div>

To dev locally and see differences in the html, I run `mix phx.server`

I created a couple of convenience scripts to help deploy and build (generate) the files

I had to adjust the .gitignore quite a bit

Moving the old posts to the new format was a bit annoying, but 

Here is the mix task that does the magic:

Half of my family is from Brazil and I am proud of my heritage. "Gambiarra" is a word in Portuguese (I would love for the language to be called Brazilian, but that's a different discussion altogether :) ) that comes up a lot in Brazilian culture.

  On not stopping, better yet, continuing
</div>

<p class="my-4">
  Folks that know me know that I've been playing and enjoying padel (a lot)
  lately. At first, for many months, I struggled with getting back in shape,
  with doing motions that at one time were seamless, with the discrepancy of
  what I KNEW my body could do (at some point at least) and what it was doing.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  If you didn't know me from before, it was probably a weird experience to see
  someone try things and fail, SO often and yet, continue to fail and continue
  to try. In short, that's how I go about life, so far at least. There are no
  plans on changing this either. It's what made me have the amazing things I've
  gotten so far in my life.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  I was fortunate, VERY fortunate to have folks that knew me from before that
  would celebrate the small wins (better failures) with me. Whether it was
  celebrating losing some weight I had put on (heaviest ever in my life) or
  talking about how things were starting to fall into place, or just asking me
  to try something to see how it felt.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  Honestly, it was a tough time. Mentally. On top of everything else that was
  going on in life, one of the things that I just knew how to do just wasn't
  there anymore. There is getting old, indeed. But there is also not being
  where you CAN do (even with your old body) at all. Just so distant from being
  able to execute things. If you just can't because you are old, that's one
  thing. Sometimes, life puts you all the way down in the hierarchy of needs
  and skipping any level is just not prudent, not something I'd do. The amazing
  thing now is that I'm back at getting to focus on cool things like Padel.
  Let's GOOOOO!
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  It's not perfect though. There is still a lot to do physically to feel at
  ease and comfortable but I got somewhere where I'm at least happy and
  enjoying racket sports again. I'm at a point now where I can look forward and
  not just backwards. There is no reason to learn how to run in different ways
  if you can't even walk anymore. I'm back walking, even better, jogging. I'm
  very happy to be here.

  On Padel balls - how often are they changed?
</div>

<p class="my-4">
  Now that we know I'm interested in Padel, let's dive deeper into a VERY
  important attribute of the game: the balls and how often they are changed. It
  turns out this matters quite a bit in the sport as some shots are much harder
  if to hit with older (more used) balls in certain conditions and moments in a
  match. It's fascinating, honestly.

<p class="my-4">
  I went directly to one of the most active (and best) players here in the US,
  Luis Estrada, and asked him about his experiences with ball changes in
  tournaments. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/luisitoestrada"
