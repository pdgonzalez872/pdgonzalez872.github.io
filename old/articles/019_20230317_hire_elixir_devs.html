  2023-03-17 | On hiring Elixir Devs
</h2>

<h3> (Turn your phone sideways if you are on mobile) </h3>

<p>
  Sometimes I get emails from folks that are interested in hiring for Elixir. When folks are kind, I usually try to help out in any way I can.

  What I usually (if you are kind) reply:

<p>
  I'm a member of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (https://erlef.org/) and part of that in my opinion is making sure folks know how to reach Elixir devs when they need to. I'm very interested in helping you showcase that your company is hiring so heavily for Elixir. Since you were kind in our email exchange, I'll return the kindness and hopefully help you find as many Elixir devs you can hire :). Just promise me to keep creating more Elixir jobs : ) :

  Here are some interesting ways to find Elixir devs:
  - Create a post ElixirForum (https://elixirforum.com). Some folks watch the `jobs` category, so you should get interest there as well.
  - Add a job to Elixir Radar https://elixir-radar.com/post-your-job-listing-in-the-elixir-radar-for-free. A lot of folks subscribe to the newsletter and watch the jobs section quite closely.
  - Add a job to the ElixirCompanies website: https://elixir-companies.com/en. If you log in with a Github account (create one if you don't have it yet :) ) it should allow you to post a job there. If that doesn't work (it should) please let me know.
  - Post on Hacker News "Who is hiring" thread for the month. https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring. Make sure to mention Elixir, how your company is heavily invested in Elixir and you will get a ton of interest through there.
  - Post a job to the #jobs channel in the Elixir Slack. There is a format folks like jobs posted there, so please follow that. You can get an invite to Elixir Slack here: https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com. If that doesn't work, please let me know and I can invite you personally.
  
  Late language adopters usually want a good flow of job postings before considering learning a language. We are seeing tons of Elixir jobs lately. It will only continue to increase, since Elixir is excellent and a joy to use. Elixir jobs is something I monitor frequently (I should automate this somehow at some point actually) and it makes me very happy to see how the community is growing in that regard.
  
  Thanks again for reaching out, hope you hire a ton of Elixir devs! Good luck!
