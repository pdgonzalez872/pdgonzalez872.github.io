  2024-04-22 | Geocoder using PostGis in Postgres
</h2>

<h3> (Turn your phone sideways if you are on mobile) </h3>

<h3>
  TLDR: Open Source Software is beautiful. What an amazing time to be alive and
  work with software.
</h3>

<p>
  Addresses are a fascinating vertical. I've worked with addresses in the past
  in side projects, consulting projects and full time jobs. I learned thing or
  two about them, including the difference of a valid address and a mailable
  address, but that's for a different conversation. Recently, I worked on a side
  project and thought about plotting some addresses on a map.
</p>

<p>
  Plotting a single point or a few points is straightforward.  You need a
  lat/lon value that generates a point, then, you use that point in a map.  One
  of the ways to do this is to use a geocoding api, send your address to it, pay
  for usage, get the lat/lon back and call it a day. I've done this in the past
  and it's a legit way to build things. In this side project, for science
  reasons, I wanted to see what it would take to do get a lat/lon for a bunch of
  values, not just one. These api services have caps on them. Google Maps gives
  you 100k requests a month, 500k if you ask (beg) them for it. There is another
  one that has tiers, one for 100k ($10/mo) and one for 1mil ($50/mo). In this
  case, I pretended I had a couple of million existing records that I wanted to
  backpopulate/hydrate with lat/lon values. This blog explores an alternative to
  the api route: using open source tools (Postgresql, Postgis[0]) and data
  (OpenStreetMaps) to solve the geocoding problem. In short, the problem
  statement is: when given an address in the US, please give me the lat/lon
  values for it. Now, do it for X addresses. It's a simple ask, for the non
  technical folks and a fairly interesting problem for the technical ones. I'll
  explain some takeaways below.
</p>

<p>
  To explore this, I did some thinking, some research, some GPTing, a lot of
  reading the docs and only after I had tried loading some data in the database
  I ran into some VERY useful articles that showed the way. In hindsight, it
  would have been great to have found them before, but I learned a thing or two
  in some rabbit holes (did you know that: the posgresql package for Ubuntu
  Lunar (23.04) were archived, Ubuntu has a 23.10 called Mantic, a couple other
  things as well). Always something to learn. I digress.
</p>

<p>
  The goal here is to build a geocoder leveraging Postgresql's PostGis[0]
  extension and using TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing)
  census data[1]. The ultimate goal is to be able to take
  in an address, call a function with it as an input and output a lat/lon
  associated with the input.
</p>

  Here is a successful function call in all it's glory after it was all said and done

<h3>
  Existing literature
</h3>

<p>
  I wasn't surprised to find a blog from Ryan Lambert on this topic[2]. I
  bought Ryan's book about Postgis but haven't had the chance to dig in other
  than on a weekend at nights last year. I've been interested in charts and
  maps for a big part of my life and his book lives in the intersection of
  these concepts. On one hand, I'm thankful for not bumping into it earlier, it
  made me have to solve a couple of problems on my own but once that was done,
  it was mostly about reading the docs and expanding a little bit on what Ryan
  had on his article (mostly about getting all of the data for the US). It
  would have been nice to have found it first though. Ryan mentioned he
  followed a different article when building his project, so I thought I'd link
  it here as well: article from Michelle Tobias[3]. Alright, with all that out
  of the way, let's move on.
</p>

<h4>
  Loading data for all 50 states
</h4>

<p>
  The one thing Ryan's article and the Tiger + PostGis docs [4] didn't give
  snipets for was how to get the data for all of the US in one go. I had to
  modify the command above to pass in a list of all the 50 states. Then, I had
  to do some `sed` work to replace the `PGPASSWORD` that was hardcoded
  incorrectly and also the database (since I didn't pass it in like Ryan did
  above). The errors were good and lead you to solutions though, no complaints.
  Once I had that, I monitored the first couple of states, saw the tables be
  created in the database and did some quick back of the napkin math to see if
  my little machine[5] in the living room would have enough room to fit all the
  data we were putting in. I decided to do it and went to bed, so I don't know
  how long it took for everything to load.  It was ready when I woke up though.
  In the end, it was 136GB for all of the US.
</p>

<pre><code># I had a one liner, but it was too long for this blog. I asked GPT for a multiline one:
# passing in the `-d` flag did nothing unfortunately.
psql -U postgres -h localhost --no-psqlrc -d osm_data -tA -c \
"SELECT Loader_Generate_Script(ARRAY['AL', 'AK', 'AZ', 'AR', 'CA', 'CO', \
'CT', 'DE', 'FL', 'GA', 'HI', 'ID', 'IL', 'IN', 'IA', 'KS', 'KY', 'LA', 'ME', \
'MD', 'MA', 'MI', 'MN', 'MS', 'MO', 'MT', 'NE', 'NV', 'NH', 'NJ', 'NM', 'NY', \
'NC', 'ND', 'OH', 'OK', 'OR', 'PA', 'RI', 'SC', 'SD', 'TN', 'TX', 'UT', 'VT', \
'VA', 'WA', 'WV', 'WI', 'WY', 'DC'], 'sh')" > /gisdata/all_states_load.sh

# then, I had to do the following (use the right password and use the name of the database I created):
sed -i 's/export PGPASSWORD=yourpasswordhere/export PGPASSWORD=postgres/g' all_states_load.sh
sed -i 's/export PGDATABASE=geocoder/export PGDATABASE=osm_data/g' all_states_load.sh

# and finally, I did need to do was run it as `sudo` due to where the script was created
sudo ./all_states_load.sh
</code></pre>

<h3>
  Normal geocoding workflow: one address, a couple of points at a time
</h3>

<p>
  This seems to be the normal web workflow, I asked some folks about this
  problem and they haven't even considered building something locally for it.
  It's just easier to maintain and IMO the de-facto solution for this problem.
</p>

<p>
  I just don't think the use case I had in mind is a real one. It's not a source
  of pain for many folks.
</p>

<h3>
  Doing it at scale -> in bulk/backpopulating an existing table
</h3>

<p>
  This is the non-standard web flow. This is usually done by data folks that are
  looking at data on their local machine or a local beefy server somewhere.
</p>

<p>
  I thought about a few ways to optimize a backpop with the setup above. None
  quite excellent in my opinion. Likely the best one would be to use a beefy
  computer where these queries would be trivial (would be interesting to
  benchmark the results).
</p>

<p>
  But in the end, the problem is still annoying, either because you need to do
  it one request at a time (individually) or need to support an infrastructure
  somewhere to do it in bulk. Appending geocoding to addresses in bulk is
  challenging. It seems like it's more of a dynamic problem, folks handle a few
  For example: Lyft and Uber may get a request for an address and persist that
  geo. They do it on the spot, not after. This may be the way.
</p>

<p>
  Who knows, maybe this could be a service. CSV in, CSV with 2 extra columns out.
</p>

<h4>
  Creating scripts leveraging Postgres
</h4>

<p>
  One cool thing I saw was how folks were able to leverage a table in Postgres
  to create text files (scripts) locally: Here is part of the process:
</p>

<code><pre>-- Source: https://github.com/postgis/postgis/blob/master/extras/tiger_geocoder/tiger_loader_2023.sql#L218-L240

  INSERT INTO loader_platform(os, wget, pgbin, declare_sect, unzip_command, psql, path_sep, loader, environ_set_command, county_process_command)
  VALUES('sh', 'wget', '',
  E'TMPDIR="${staging_fold}/temp/"
  UNZIPTOOL=unzip
  WGETTOOL="/usr/bin/wget"
  export PGBIN=/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin
  export PGPORT=5432
  export PGHOST=localhost
  export PGUSER=postgres
  export PGPASSWORD=yourpasswordhere
  export PGDATABASE=geocoder
  PSQL=${PGBIN}/psql
  SHP2PGSQL=shp2pgsql
  cd ${staging_fold}
  ', E'rm -f ${TMPDIR}/*.*
  ${PSQL} -c "DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS ${staging_schema} CASCADE;"
  ${PSQL} -c "CREATE SCHEMA ${staging_schema};"
  for z in *.zip; do $UNZIPTOOL -o -d $TMPDIR $z; done
  cd $TMPDIR;\n', '${PSQL}', '/', '${SHP2PGSQL}', 'export ',
  'for z in *${table_name}*.dbf; do
  ${loader} -D -s 4269 -g the_geom -W "latin1" $z ${staging_schema}.${state_abbrev}_${table_name} | ${psql}
  ${PSQL} -c "SELECT loader_load_staged_data(lower(''${state_abbrev}_${table_name}''), lower(''${state_abbrev}_${lookup_name}''));"
  done');
</code></pre>

<p>
  Here is where the function is defined in the code:

<p>
  Then, the docs GUIDE YOU [4] to execute that query as arg to psql and pipe it
  to a file like the below... isn't that amazing? The docs show a version, but
  I'm showing Ryan's due to the `--no-psqlrc` flag, that bit me and had me do an
  extra search to find how to skip it :) Maybe it will save you 5 mins.

  * Living Room small box, target data in same database: In my
  benchmarks, it took ~13s to do one record, so 15s is fairly
  safe as an upper bound duration estimate.

<p>
  I'd love to benchmark this on a very powerful machine. That's for another time
  (maybe decade?) though.

<h3>
  OpenStreetMaps db size and shape
</h3>

<p>
  As I mentioned above, in the end of the process I had 136GB in the database,
  at least, according to DBeaver. A friend asked me about the counts in some
  tables, so I looked into it. The loading scripts organize the data into
  different schemas (tiger, tiger_data, tiger_staging)  and then in different
  tables for each state. It names them appropriately as well.
</p>

<p>
  Let's isolate IL in this case. In the `tiger_data` schema, we have a few tables for IL:
</p>

<img src="../images/il_tiger_data_sizes.png" alt="jellyfish" style="max-width: 100%;max-height: 100%;">

<p>
  And here are some counts for IL:
