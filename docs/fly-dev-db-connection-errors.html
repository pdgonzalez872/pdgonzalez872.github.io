  Sometimes, things break. That's just how things are. One time, I realized I
  was getting DbConnection errors in an app hosted on Fly (using Fly Posgres),
  even with low usage in an app. It was odd, came out of nowhere. You could see
  the connections dropping and then going back up.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  The confusing thing was that there was no trigger for this. It just started
  happening. After some research, I decided to contact Fly's support, which
  have always been super helpful. They showed me that one of the three machines
  I had for my database was stuck in a boot loop and would never reach
  available state. It seemed like it was just long enough to take some
  connections from the pool, but would crash soon later. It was there on the
  dashboard if you looked at all the machines. It was tucked a click away
  though, I was not able to see it from the main dashboard, the db (overall
  health) was green. Now I know to look there and in hindsight, I should have.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  Support gave me direction on how to fix the problem. In short, you had to
  destroy the bad machine and clone a good one. That's why we have more than 1
  machine (like Fly suggests). As usual, I write a lot when working and had
  some notes. When this happened again a couple weeks back, I was prepared.
  Here are the notes that have helped me:

><code># Steps to destroy a bad machine (and volume) and clone a good one - fly postgres
# list the machines, get the id for the bad one
$ fly machine list --app <your_db_app>

# list the volumes, get the volume attached to the bad one
$ fly volumes list --app <your_db_app>

# had to use --force, cli suggested, worked
$ fly machine destroy <bad_machine_id> --force --app <your_db_app>

$ fly volumes destroy <bad_volume_id> --app <your_db_app>

$ fly volumes list --app <your_db_app>
$ fly machine clone <good_machine_id> --region <target_region> --app <your_db_app>

# confirm
$ fly volumes list --app <your_db_app>
$ fly machine list --app <your_db_app>
</code></pre>

  Hope this helps! It has helped me a couple of times already. I also want to
  give props to Fly's email support. It's always been helpful.
