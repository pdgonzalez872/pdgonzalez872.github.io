  2020 has been interesting (to say the least) for a number of reasons. One of
  them is the fact that Roland Garros (the only clay court Grand Slam in the
  season) was moved from June to September. A usual clay court season is
  comprised of multiple tournaments on clay so players can get rhythm and be at
  the top of their game when it comes to RG. RG is the last of the clay court
  tournaments (at least the highest level ones) in the season. So my favorite
  tennis season is happenning as we speak! This is excellent.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  Racket sports have been a big part of my life. Competing in these sports
  has also played a big part in my life. I was never involved with managing
  tournaments, only played them. You basically followed orders: got a time, a
  court and went out to play your match.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  Now that we were watching some tennis on tv, I wondered how things work under
  the hood. Lots of interesting questions and fairly complex problems come up
  when you are managing a tournament. Creating the draw, scheduling the matches,
  managing the results and many more non-trivial issues. The issue I want to
  discuss today is a fairly simple one: how to deal with the result of a match
  and advance the winner to the correct position in the next round.
</p>

<p class="mb-2">
  Imagine the following 4 player tournament:
</p>

<pre class="text-sm"></code>
Semifinals
|-----------------------|
|         Paulo         |
|-----------------------|---------
|       Rafa Nadal      |        |         Finals
|-----------------------|        |-----------------------|
                                 |           ?           |
                                 |-----------------------|
                                 |           ?           |
                                 |-----------------------|
|-----------------------|        |
|         Silvia        |        |
|-----------------------|---------
|     Roger Federer     |
|-----------------------|
</code></pre>

<p class="my-4">
  You get the following results:
</p>

<ul>
  <li class="mb-2">
    - Paulo beats Rafa Nadal 6/7 7/6 7/6
  </li>
  <li class="mb-2">
    - Silvia beats Roger Federer 6/2 6/0
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-4">
  You then need to update the tournament draw to show the below:

  The approach below seems to work for our use case and is a great example of how
  important it is to frame a problem and play with the data.
</p>


<p class="mb-4">
  As with every problem, it is imperative to try different approaches and how you
  frame the problem means a lot. I've seen that the solution (and how fast you can
  get to it) is directly correlated to how a problem is framed.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
  After talking to Kels and Kristen for a little bit, we arrived at the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li class="mb-2">
    - A round will have different matches
  </li>
  <li class="mb-2">
    - A round also have positions, starting from the 1 going top to
    bottom
  </li>
  <li class="mb-2">
    - Each of the matches in the round should have a number, starting from 1 going
    top to bottom
  </li>
  <li class="mb-2">
    - A match will have two positions: top and bottom
  </li>
</ul>

  In order to solve for "how to advance a player" we looked at an existing draw in
  a tournament that is about to start this week in <a

  Here is a screenshot of the draw:
</p>

<img src="/images/hamburg.png" alt="hamburg-draw"
  class="w-full max-w-xs sm:max-w-sm md:max-w-md lg:max-w-lg xl:max-w-xl mx-auto my-4 rounded-lg shadow-md object-cover"/>

<p class="my-4">
  It was a lot easier to reason about things when I had the table above to look
  at. To me, it was clear that the algorithm to advance a player to the correct
  position is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li class="mb-2">
    - In order to get the next round's match number: If the match number
    is even, divide by 2. If odd, add 1 and divide by 2. The result
    is the match number in the next round.
  </li>
  <li class="mb-2">
    - In order to get the next round's position: this will be the same as the
    match number where the player came from.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="my-4">
  If we look at Silvia's example above, she had position #3 and was playing
  match #2 in the round. So, (match #2 is even) -> 2 / 2 -> 1. So she is playing
  in next round's match #1. Since she came from match #2, her position in the
  next round's match #1 will be #2.
