  TLDR: Open Source Software is beautiful. What an amazing time to be alive and
  work with software.
</div>

<p class="my-4">
  Addresses are a fascinating vertical. I've worked with addresses in the past
  in side projects, consulting projects and full time jobs. I learned thing or
  two about them, including the difference of a valid address and a mailable
  address, but that's for a different conversation. Recently, I worked on a side
  project and thought about plotting some addresses on a map.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  Plotting a single point or a few points is straightforward.  You need a
  lat/lon value that generates a point, then, you use that point in a map.  One
  of the ways to do this is to use a geocoding api, send your address to it,
  pay for usage, get the lat/lon back and call it a day. I've done this in the
  past and it's a legit way to build things. In this side project, for science
  reasons, I wanted to see what it would take to do get a lat/lon for a bunch
  of values, not just one. These api services have caps on them. Google Maps
  gives you 100k requests a month, 500k if you ask (beg) them for it. There is
  another one that has tiers, one for 100k ($10/mo) and one for 1mil ($50/mo).
  In this case, I pretended I had a couple of million existing records that I
  wanted to backpopulate/hydrate with lat/lon values. This blog explores an
  alternative to the api route: using open source tools (Postgresql, <a
    href="https://postgis.net" class="text-blue-400"
    target="_blank">PostGis</a>) and data (OpenStreetMaps) to solve the
  geocoding problem. In short, the problem statement is: when given an address
  in the US, please give me the lat/lon values for it. Now, do it for X
  addresses. It's a simple ask, for the non technical folks and a fairly
  interesting problem for the technical ones. I'll explain some takeaways
  below.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  To explore this, I did some thinking, some research, some GPTing, a lot of
  reading the docs and only after I had tried loading some data in the database
  I ran into some VERY useful articles that showed the way. In hindsight, it
  would have been great to have found them before, but I learned a thing or two
  in some rabbit holes (did you know that: the posgresql package for Ubuntu
  Lunar (23.04) was archived, Ubuntu has a 23.10 called Mantic, a couple other
  things as well). Always something to learn. I digress.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  The goal here is to build a geocoder leveraging Postgresql's PostGis[0]
  extension and using <a
                          href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/tiger-data-products-guide.html"

                        Referencing) census data</a>. The ultimate goal is to
  be able to take in an address, call a function with it as
  an input and output a lat/lon associated with the input.

  I wasn't surprised to find <a
    href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2023/10/geocode-with-postgis-setup"
    class="text-blue-400" target="_blank">a blog from Ryan Lambert on this
  topic</a>. I bought Ryan's book about Postgis but haven't had the chance to
  dig in other than on a weekend at nights last year. I've been interested in
  charts and maps for a big part of my life and his book lives in the
  intersection of these concepts. On one hand, I'm thankful for not bumping
  into it earlier, it made me have to solve a couple of problems on my own but
  once that was done, it was mostly about reading the docs and expanding a
  little bit on what Ryan had on his article (mostly about getting all of the
  data for the US). It would have been nice to have found it first though. Ryan
  mentioned he followed a different article when building his project, so I
  thought I'd link it here as well: <a
      href="https://experimentalcraft.wordpress.com/2017/11/01/how-to-make-a-postgis-tiger-geocoder-in-less-than-5-day" class="text-blue-400" target="_blank">
      article from Michelle Tobias</a>. Alright, with all that out of the way,
    let's move on.
</p>

<h4>
  Loading data for all 50 states
</h4>

<p class="my-4">
  The one thing Ryan's article and <a href="https://postgis.net/docs/postgis_installation.html#install_tiger_geocoder_extension" class="text-blue-400" target="_blank">the Tiger + PostGis docs</a> didn't give
  snipets for was how to get the data for all of the US in one go. I had to
  modify the command above to pass in a list of all the 50 states. Then, I had
  to do some `sed` work to replace the `PGPASSWORD` that was hardcoded
  incorrectly and also the database (since I didn't pass it in like Ryan did
  above). The errors were good and lead you to solutions though, no complaints.
  Once I had that, I monitored the first couple of states, saw the tables be
  created in the database and did some quick back of the napkin math to see if
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B1WX25TV" class="text-blue-400"
    target="_blank">my little machine</a> in the living room would have enough
  room to fit all the data we were putting in. I decided to do it and went to
  bed, so I don't know how long it took for everything to load.  It was ready
  when I woke up though.  In the end, it was 136GB for all of the US.
</p>

<pre class="text-xs"><code># I had a one liner, but it was too long for this blog. I asked GPT for a multiline one:
# passing in the `-d` flag did nothing unfortunately.

# then, I had to do the following (use the right password and use the name of the database I created):
sed -i 's/export PGPASSWORD=yourpasswordhere/export PGPASSWORD=postgres/g' all_states_load.sh
sed -i 's/export PGDATABASE=geocoder/export PGDATABASE=osm_data/g' all_states_load.sh

# and finally, I did need to do was run it as `sudo` due to where the script was created
sudo ./all_states_load.sh
</code></pre>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-6">
  Normal geocoding workflow: one address, a couple of points at a time
</div>

<p class="my-4">
  This seems to be the normal web workflow, I asked some folks about this
  problem and they haven't even considered building something locally for it.
  It's just easier to maintain and IMO the de-facto solution for this problem.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  I just don't think the use case I had in mind is a real one. It's not a source
  of pain for many folks.
</p>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-6">
  Doing it at scale -> in bulk/backpopulating an existing table
</div>

<p class="my-4">
  This is the non-standard web flow. This is usually done by data folks that are
  looking at data on their local machine or a local beefy server somewhere.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  I thought about a few ways to optimize a backpop with the setup above. None
  quite excellent in my opinion. Likely the best one would be to use a beefy
  computer where these queries would be trivial (would be interesting to
  benchmark the results).
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  But in the end, the problem is still annoying, either because you need to do
  it one request at a time (individually) or need to support an infrastructure
  somewhere to do it in bulk. Appending geocoding to addresses in bulk is
  challenging. It seems like it's more of a dynamic problem, folks handle a few
  For example: Lyft and Uber may get a request for an address and persist that
  geo. They do it on the spot, not after. This may be the way.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  Who knows, maybe this could be a service. CSV in, CSV with 2 extra columns out.

  Then, the docs GUIDE YOU [4] to execute that query as arg to psql and pipe it
  to a file like the below... isn't that amazing? The docs show a version, but
  I'm showing Ryan's due to the `--no-psqlrc` flag, that bit me and had me do an
  extra search to find how to skip it :) Maybe it will save you 5 mins.
