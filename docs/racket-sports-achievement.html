<p class="my-4">
  I wanted to write about platform tennis.

  It's a great racket sport I picked up after college. It was the sport that helped me develop my body (my shoulder doubled in size) and

  I had a blast playing it, the league, the travel tour. The world stopped in March 2020 and I eventually made a decision to not return to platform. stop playing because while it started to not become a priority for me
</p>

<p class="my-4">
  As far as playing level, I played well, but didn't play it the right way. I did it my way, a fun way to spent my time doing my hobby. Platform can get very slow and I never adapted to what was needed to really win a platform match. I didn't want to play 12 minute points like my good friend Randy Lofgren, nor play a 6hr match like Graham and Adam did. While I'm super proud of their achievements, that's just not for me and that's ok. I've learned to deal with it.

  username/password are input in their respective fields in the GUI. Here is a
