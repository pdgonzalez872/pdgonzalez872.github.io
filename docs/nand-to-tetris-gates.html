For this blog post I build on the introspection theme I've written about
before. The intent here is to understand the abstrations that make computing
possible.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
 We return to <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org" class="text-blue-400" target="_blank"=>NandToTetris Book</a> once
 again. This is <a href="www.nand2tetris.org/project01" class="text-blue-400" target="_blank"</a>Project 1 in the
 course</a>, but in Elixir.
</p>

<div class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-6">
  Project 1 - Boolean Logic - Create logic gates used in a typical 16-bit machine
</div>

<p class="my-4">
The Nand gate is the starting abstraction of the whole <a
  href="https://www.nand2tetris.org" class="text-blue-400"
  target="_blank"=>NandToTetris project</a>.  We are supposed to create all the
remaining gates (and abstractions that use gates) based on it. Below are all of
the gates required for Project 1 and their suggested order. I skipped the 16
bit examples for simplicity sake.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>- Nand </li>
  <li>- Not </li>
  <li>- And </li>
  <li>- Or </li>
  <li>- Xor </li>
  <li>- Mux </li>
  <li>- DMux </li>
</ul>

<p class="my-4">
I used <a href="http://www.nandgame.com" class="text-blue-400"
target="_blank"</a>http://www.nandgame.com</a> to help visualize the
problems. Honestly, without the visual feedback I would not have been able to
solve any of the problems above.

I had to look up the <a href="http://improve.dk/creating-multiplexers-using-logic-gates" class="text-blue-400"
target="_blank"</a>Mux implementation</a>. Amazing solution. Once I understood
what DMux meant, the solution was straight forward. But to understand it, I
read material that basically said what the implementation would look like.

<h2>
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p class="my-4">
I'm so happy this book and course exist. I've had this book for a couple of
years now and it doesn't seem like I can ever fully grasp its content. It feels
like a bible, a reference book that I will continue to always refer back to and
dig a little deeper.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
The videos (coursera course, can be found on youtube) are very important. They
help close gaps. The book is concise, each sentence in the book is heavy and
means a lot.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
As an example, I worked on a concept mentioned in the book. It was a side
passage, just a paragraph noting that calculations could be done using stacks.
  It took me a couple of days (stack based calculator) to implement something
  that the book mentioned as trivial. The <a
                                              href="https://pdgonzalez872.github.io/stack-arithmetic-calculator.html"
                                              class="text-blue-400"
                                              target="_blank"</a>result was
                                          pretty neat</a> in my opinion.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
For the sake of time, I will continue to treat this book as a reference and
something I will continue to come back to (as I've done multiple times already)
in my career.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
The main technical idea (the crux) in the book is the concept of abstractions.
There comes a point in pretty much everything in life where one must choose a
layer of abstraction that works for their use cases. The book does a great job
a giving abstractions to the student when they deem necessary. We don't
implement Nand gates. We don't implement Flip Flop gates. Jack is a small
language. The OS doesn't do everything that all OSes do. Implementations of the
projects are not optimized. The authors of course are the first ones to let the
students know. Choosing abstractions that add value is an art.
</p>

<p class="my-4">
This blissful ignorance of choosing an abstraction layer can be seen as both a
feature or a bug. I think it is important to know the layers exist and even
more important that they are non-trivial. A critical error here would be to
think that a single individual (an arrogant, naive one) deems the layers as
"simple" or "easy". They are not. So much work, so many geniuses worked on
every single layer so we could get what we have today.
</p>

The computer is my favorite invention of all time. Hands down.
