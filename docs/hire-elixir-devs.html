  This started as a draft email, then a <a
    href="https://gist.github.com/pdgonzalez872/88204f0db6ed04a4adaf9f6948ef445e"
    class="text-blue-400" target="_blank">gist</a>, then I <a
    href="https://elixirforum.com/t/hiring-section-maybe/57883"
    class="text-blue-400" target="_blank">asked the community if there was value</a>, then I <a
    href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir-lang.github.com/pull/1720"
    class="text-blue-400" target="_blank">created PR in Elixir</a> and finally <a

    class="text-blue-400" target="_blank">we added this info to the wiki!</a>

  Sometimes I get emails from folks that are interested in hiring for Elixir. When folks are kind, I usually try to help out in any way I can.

I'm a member of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (https://erlef.org/) and part
of that in my opinion is making sure folks know how to reach Elixir devs when
they need to. I'm very interested in helping you showcase that your company is
hiring so heavily for Elixir. Since you were kind in our email exchange, I'll
return the kindness and hopefully help you find as many Elixir devs you can
hire :). Just promise me to keep creating more Elixir jobs : ) :

Here are some interesting ways to find Elixir devs:

- Create a post ElixirForum (https://elixirforum.com). Some folks watch the
`jobs` category, so you should get interest there as well.

- Add a job to Elixir Radar
https://elixir-radar.com/post-your-job-listing-in-the-elixir-radar-for-free. A
lot of folks subscribe to the newsletter and watch the jobs section quite
closely.

- Add a job to the ElixirCompanies website: https://elixir-companies.com/en. If
you log in with a Github account (create one if you don't have it yet :) ) it
should allow you to post a job there. If that doesn't work (it should) please
let me know.

- Post on Hacker News "Who is hiring" thread for the month.
https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=whoishiring. Make sure to mention
Elixir, how your company is heavily invested in Elixir and you will get a ton
of interest through there.

- Post a job to the #jobs channel in the Elixir Slack. There is a format folks
like jobs posted there, so please follow that. You can get an invite to Elixir
Slack here: https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com. If that doesn't work, please
let me know and I can invite you personally.

Late language adopters usually want a good flow of job postings before
considering learning a language. We are seeing tons of Elixir jobs lately. It
will only continue to increase, since Elixir is excellent and a joy to use.
Elixir jobs is something I monitor frequently (I should automate this somehow
at some point actually) and it makes me very happy to see how the community is
growing in that regard.

Thanks again for reaching out, hope you hire a ton of Elixir devs! Good luck!
